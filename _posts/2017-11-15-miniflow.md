## What is a Neural Network

- A neural network is **a graph of mathematical functions**:
    - **linear combinations** and **activation functions**. 
- The graph consists of **nodes**, and **edges**.

![example-neural-network]({{ "/assets/img/miniflow/example-neural-network.png" | absolute_url }}){: .center-image }{:height="400px"}

- **Nodes** in each layer (except for nodes in the input layer) **perform mathematical functions** using inputs from nodes in the previous layers. 
    - For example, a node could represent $$f(x,y)=x+y$$, where $$x$$ and $$y$$ are **input values from nodes in the previous layer**.
- Each **node creates an output value** which may be passed to nodes in the next layer. 
    - The output value from the output layer does not get passed to a future layer (last layer!)
- Layers between the input layer and the output layer are called **hidden layers**.
- The **edges** in the graph describe **the connections between the nodes**, along which the values flow from one layer to the next. 
    - These edges can also apply operations to the values that flow along them, such as **multiplying by weights, adding biases**, etc..

## Graphs

- The **nodes** and **edges** create a **graph structure**. 
- It isn't hard to imagine that increasingly **complex graphs** can calculate **almost anything**.
- There are generally **two steps to create neural networks**:
    - **Define the graph** of nodes and edges.
    - **Propagate values** through the graph.

## Gradient Descent

- Technically, the gradient actually **points uphill**, in the direction of **steepest ascent**. 
- But if we put a `-` sign in front of this value, we get the direction of **steepest descent**, which is what we want.
- **How much force** should be applied to the **push**. This is known as the **learning rate**.
    - which is an apt name since this value determines how quickly or slowly the neural network learns.
- This is more of a guessing game than anything else but empirically values in the range **0.1 to 0.0001 work well**. 
    - The range **0.001 to 0.0001 is popular**, as **0.1 and 0.01 are sometimes too large**.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

- Stochastic Gradient Descent (**SGD**) is a **version of Gradient Descent**
    - Where on each forward pass **a batch of data** is randomly sampled from total dataset.
- Ideally, **the entire dataset** would be fed into the neural network on **each forward pass**.
    - But in practice, it's not practical due to **memory constraints**.
- SGD is an **approximation** of Gradient Descent.
    - **The more batches** processed by the neural network, **the better the approximation**.


#### A naïve implementation of SGD involves:
1. Randomly sample a batch of data from the total dataset.
2. Running the network forward and backward to calculate the gradient (with data from (1)).
3. Apply the gradient descent update.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until convergence or the loop is stopped by another mechanism (i.e. the number of epochs).
